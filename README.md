DISCLAIMER : Doesn't work for folders, only put images in the folder you need to sort

Features:
- Sort your images by creation date or modification date

Creation date: may turn out to be wrong: Windows replaces the creation date of a file when it is downloaded from another device

- In case of a bug, make a backup

Example of a bug: windows explorer crashes

- Change creation date to modification date for greater precision in the file explorer

PIP Dependencies:
- pywin32
